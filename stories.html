                    <p>Toby the tiny mouse was always rushing. "I wish I could skip to tomorrow!" he would say. One day, he built a small time machine from a walnut shell and some sparkly dust.</p>
                    <p>With a whoosh, Toby zoomed to tomorrow, then next week, then next year! But everywhere he went, he felt something was missing. The flowers he passed didn't smell as sweet, and his friends seemed far away.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Toby returned to today and discovered his friends had planned a surprise picnic for him. "We missed you!" they cheered. Toby realized that while tomorrow is exciting, today is where the real magic happens.</p>
                    <p>From then on, Toby enjoyed every moment, knowing that the present is the best gift of all.</p>
